                   <h2>Jackson Falls, IL</h2>
                   <p>
                       Jackson Falls is a climbing area in the Shawnee Forest of southern Illinois. It's home to some of the best sandstone to
                       climb on in the country. Claiming over 300 routes in the one canyon in just about every grade range, there's something there to 
                       climb for even the best of climbers. The second picture is of a route called Viking Blood, in my opinion one of the best routes 
                       in the whole canyon. By a long shot, this is my favorite place to climb in the midwest, it's where I first learned and it is where
                       I continue top develope my skills.

                   <h2>Red River Gorge, KY</h2>
                   <p>
                       Welcome to the Red River Gorge! Located in Kentucky, this is THE climbing destination to test and push yourself against some of the 
                       longest routes in the world! There are close to 1,500 routes in this gorge making the idea of choosing which one to climb seem very 
                       daunting, luckily there exists multiple guidebooks laying out every route including a "best of" section to help you narrow it down. 
                       Inevitably, you will be hungry and when it comes to climbers food in the Red, there's no better place to go than Miguel's Pizza!

                   <h2>The Holy Boulders, IL</h2>
                   <p>
                       Climber's make the pilgrimage to the Holy Boulders from all over the midwest for it's bullet hard sandstone 
                       and classic lines. Unlike the previous 2 destinations, the Holy Boulders, or just Holies, are purely a field 
                       of boulders and not a state park, so access can be difficult for this area. Upkeep is done by climbers and climbing access associations
                       like the Beta Fund or the ICA. Be sure to visit in November, when temperatures are just right and there's a huge competition and after party in a field 
                       adjacent to the boulders.

                   <h2>Elephant Rocks State Park, MO</h2>
                   <p>
                       Many people in St. Louis have probably already heard of Elephant Rocks State Park, fewer have probably seen climbers there, and fewer still have probably actually climbed there.
                       Elepant Rocks, or E-rocks as climbers call it, is filled with granite boulders! The rock is super sharp and lends itself well to a style of climbing where you don't jump for any of the holds, 
                       for slipping off of the rock is real tough on the skin. E-rocks takes some getting used to, but once you do, it has some of the best bouldering in the midwest.

                   <h2>Devil's Lake State Park, WI</h2>
                   <p>
                       Located in Wisconsin, the lake surrounded by quarzite is a major destination for trad climbers and boulderers alike. Devil's Lake trad climbing is unfortuneatly notorious for their accidents 
                       when it comes to trad climbing. One possible reason is because the type of rock that exists there is pretty slick, although another could just come down to climber's inexperience. Regardless, this place
                       is still home to some amazing climbing and is a great spot in the midwest to venture to during the summer months as it doesn't get nearly as humid there as it does further south, and even if you're not climbing 
                       it is incredibly picturesque.

                   <h2>Sam's Throne, AR</h2>
                   <p>
                       When climbers think, "Arkansas Climbing" one of two places will pop into their heads; the first being Horseshoe Canyon Ranch, the second, and in my opinion better, is Sam's Throne. 
                       Sam's Throne is again a fantastic display of super hard sandstone in the midwest and also a great place for people who are interested in learning how to trad climb, to learn from qualified individuals.
                       Trad climbing no longer has to be a "figure it out as you go" discipline. The route pictured here is called "Battle of the Bulge" named for the 10 feet of roof you have to battle around to get into some 
                       relief climbing to the anchors at the top. This route is awesome and my favorite climb at "The Throne".

                   <h2>Little Rock City, TN</h2>
                   <p>
                       Oh Little Rock City, where do I begin? Located on the side of a golf course 15 minutes away from Chattanooga, TN, this place has every kind of boulder you would 
                       ever want to climb! Named for it's cluster of boulders or "Little Rocks", LRC has been a destination for every professional climber at one time or another. With 
                       it's ease of access from the city and density of boulders it is easy to see why this place is so popular and once you go there, you'll be dreaming about the day you finally get to go 
                       back!
